# Problem #1: Two numbers on list add to k

_Date: 2020-12-18_<br/>
_Asked by **Google**_

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

_Bonus:_ Can you do this in one pass?

**Status:** SOLVED.

# Problem #2: Dynamic product array

_Date: 2020-12-19_<br/>
_Asked by **Uber**_

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

_Follow-up:_ what if you can't use division?

**Status:** SOLVED.
